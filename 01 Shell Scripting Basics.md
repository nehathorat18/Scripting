## Shell Scripting Basics 

### Task 1: Your First Script
1. Create a file `hello.sh`
2. Add the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` at the top
3. Print `Hello, DevOps!` using `echo`
4. Make it executable and run it

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

**Document:** What happens if you remove the shebang line?
--> Even when we remove the shebang line, the script still executes. It is not mandatory, but it tells the system that the script is intended to run using Bash.

### Task 2: Variables
1. Create `variables.sh` with:
   - A variable for your `NAME`
   - A variable for your `ROLE` (e.g., "DevOps Engineer")
   - Print: `Hello, I am <NAME> and I am a <ROLE>`

2. Try using single quotes vs double quotes — what's the difference?

- If you use single quotes, it will not fetch the variable value.  
- If you use double quotes, it will fetch the variable and print its value where it is called.

### Task 3: User Input with read

1. Create `greet.sh` that:
   - Asks the user for their name using `read`
   - Asks for their favourite tool
   - Prints: `Hello <name>, your favourite tool is <tool>`

### Task 4: If-Else Conditions

1. Create `check_number.sh` that:
   - Takes a number using `read`
   - Prints whether it is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**

2. Create `file_check.sh` that:
   - Asks for a filename
   - Checks if the file **exists** using `-f`
   - Prints appropriate message

---

### Task 5: Combine It All

Create `server_check.sh` that:
1. Stores a service name in a variable (e.g., `nginx`, `sshd`)
2. Asks the user: "Do you want to check the status? (y/n)"
3. If `y` — runs `systemctl status <service>` and prints whether it's **active** or **not**
4. If `n` — prints "Skipped."

### What You Learned

- How to write a basic shell script using if-else conditions to control program flow  
- `/dev/null` acts like a black hole — it discards any output redirected to it  
- How to take user input using `read` and store it in variables  
- How to use variables inside conditions with `$` to access their values  
- How to check a service status using `systemctl is-active`
