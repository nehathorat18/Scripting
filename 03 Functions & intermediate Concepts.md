### Functions & intermediate Concepts

#### Task 1: Basic Functions
1. Create `functions.sh` with:
   - A function `greet` that takes a name as argument and prints `Hello, <name>!`
   - A function `add` that takes two numbers and prints their sum
   - Call both functions from the script

#### Task 2: Functions with Return Values
1. Create `disk_check.sh` with:
   - A function `check_disk` that checks disk usage of `/` using `df -h`
   - A function `check_memory` that checks free memory using `free -h`
   - A main section that calls both and prints the results

#### Task 3: Strict Mode — `set -euo pipefail`
1. Create `strict_demo.sh` with `set -euo pipefail` at the top
2. Try using an **undefined variable** — what happens with `set -u`?
3. Try a command that **fails** — what happens with `set -e`?
4. Try a **piped command** where one part fails — what happens with `set -o pipefail`?

**Document:** What does each flag do?
- `set -e` → Stops the script immediately if any command fails.
- `set -u` → Exits the script when an undefined/unbound variable is used.
- `set -o pipefail` → Makes the entire pipeline fail if any command in the pipeline fails.

#### Task 4: Local Variables
1. Create `local_demo.sh` with:
   - A function that uses `local` keyword for variables
   - Show that `local` variables don't leak outside the function
   - Compare with a function that uses regular variables

#### Task 5: Build a Script — System Info Reporter
Create `system_info.sh` that uses functions for everything:
1. A function to print **hostname and OS info**
2. A function to print **uptime**
3. A function to print **disk usage** (top 5 by size)
4. A function to print **memory usage**
5. A function to print **top 5 CPU-consuming processes**
6. A `main` function that calls all of the above with section headers
7. Use `set -euo pipefail` at the top

#### What I Learned
- Practiced creating reusable and modular Bash scripts using functions.
- Learned how to build a System Info Reporter by combining multiple Linux commands.
- Improved script reliability using set -euo pipefail.
- Explored local and global functions/variables in shell scripting.
